# Dialog Alterations

## NP Combobox does not work

See designer, you can click on the button but not the input to change the item.

## 1. Add max height

Currently on designer it grows with content but then can overflow the screen.
Put in max height and have logical default so that overflow happens instead.

# 2. Overflow is not right

Don't overflow the header, that should also be visible.

# 3. Add dialog manager

Handle multiple dialogs

# 4. Persist position and size.

I want to swap out the content but maintain the current position and size.

# 5. Collapse

Collapse in place or collapse to bottom.
